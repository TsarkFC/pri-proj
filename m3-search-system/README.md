## How to run

You should have the `dataset` folder from the second milestone inside the milestone 3 folder.

(you may need to run npm install locally in the frontend and backend folders, not sure)

```bash
docker-compose up
cd solr/scripts
./populate_docker.sh
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Solr: http://localhost:8983
